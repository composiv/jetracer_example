# JetRacer with Muto

JetRacer is the AI Racing Robot powered by Nvidia Jetson Nano Developer Kit. It supports deep learning, auto line following, autonomous driving . Thus, it is the best place for you to start learning about AI application where you can see how the trained model being applied to the physical world. Robotic Operating System (ROS) is the natural choice for many autonomous driving. We all know that getting started with ROS is actually very challenging due to the steep learning curve of ROS. Therefore, why not we make the learning process more fun by directly using Muto and the JetRacer


## Hardware Requirements

You will need is a JetRacer autonomous AI racecar using NVIDIA Jetson Nano.

JetRacer can be obtained from (here)[https://www.waveshare.com/jetracer-ai-kit.htm]


## Software Requirements
This is an AI Racing Robot kit based on Jetson Nano Developer Kit. Supports deep learning, auto line following, autonomous driving and so on. We will use Operating System provided by given by Waveshare for the JetRacer AI Kit. You should follow the instructions at [JetRacer AI Kit Wiki Pages](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/JetRacer_AI_Kit) to setup the software and the hardware.  You can also follow basic examples to get a feel for the racer. These libraries can be also be used with ROS.  However, we will use different packages for the Car teleoperation with a gamepad and to access the camera  The [ROS Joy](http://wiki.ros.org/joy) and [ROS Jetson Camera}(https://github.com/sfalexrog/jetson_camera) packages.

### ROS on JetRacer

Nvidia JetRacer with Jeson Nano 4GB uses JetPack 4.5.1 which is based on Ubuntu 18.02. This limits the ROS version to [ROS Melodic](http://wiki.ros.org/melodic/Installation/Ubuntu), see[ROS Distros here](http://wiki.ros.org/Distributions). You do not have to install ROS seperately, the following step will do it for you.


## Installing Muto on JetRacer

It is very easy to install Muto on the JetRacer:
* Complete the hardware and software installtion steps described in [JetRacer AI Kit Wiki Pages](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/JetRacer_AI_Kit)
* Connect to you JetRacer

         ssh jetson@<YOUR JETRACER IP>

* Checkout this repository

        git clone https://github.com/composiv/jetracer_example.git

* Change into the jetracer_example folder and run the setup script

        cd jetracer_example
        ./setup.sh
        [sudo] password for jetson:

* When prompted for password enter `jetson` or your password
* Sit back and relax while ROS melodic and Muto is being installed and setup. This may take sometime depending on your network speek. Make sure the Jetracer is plugged in.

# Start Muto on JetRacer

The scripts for starting muto on the JetRace is provided. After completing  "Installing Muto on JetRacer".  
* Complete  "Installing Muto on JetRacer".  
* Connect to you JetRacer

         ssh jetson@<YOUR JETRACER IP>

* Change into the jetracer_example folder and edit the [muto.yaml](https://github.com/composiv/jetracer_example/blob/main/launch/config/muto.yaml) configuration to change its name and connect to the Muto Twin server of your choice:

## Start the Base JetRacer Stack from the dashboard

New we can start a JetRacer `Stack` on the car to get access to the `Camera`, control the Car with the `Gamepad` and visualize with `Foxglove Studio`.  
*  Got to the [`Dashboard` at https:/dashboard.composiv.ai](https:/dashboard.composiv.ai). 

<img src="assets/dashboard.gif" height=512>

*  After you start the stack. You should see something similar to the following on your console:

        ...
        [ WARN] [1667748916.584222174]: [camera] does not match name raspicam_v2 in file /home/jetson/junk/src/jetracer/jetson_camera/camera_info/raspicam_v2.yaml
        [ WARN:0] global /home/nvidia/host/build_opencv/nv_opencv/modules/videoio/src/cap_gstreamer.cpp (933) open OpenCV | GStreamer warning: Cannot query video position: status=0, value=-1, duration=-1
        WARNING: Carrier board is not from a Jetson Developer Kit.
        WARNNIG: Jetson.GPIO library has not been verified with this carrier board,
        WARNING: and in fact is unlikely to work correctly.

* Press the buttons on your Gamepad to move the JetRacer around.  You can change how the gamepad controls the car by modifying the configuration parameters in [src/jetracer/jetracer_teleop/jetracer.yaml](https://github.com/composiv/jetracer_example/blob/main/src/jetracer/jetracer_teleop/jetracer.yaml): 

## Visualizing the JetRacer with Foxglove Studio

Navigate to foxglove studio webbsite. Click on Open Connection and change the Port ID from 9090 to your own port ID. In this example, we set the websoocket port to 7777, so set the data connection to ws://locahost:7777. Now we we can import the layout. These layouts will display predfined panels suitable for visualization oÄ±f our example:
